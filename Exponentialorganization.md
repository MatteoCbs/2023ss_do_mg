### What is an exponential organization?

An exponential organization (ExO) uses innovative organizational strategies that take advantage of evolving technology to have an impact that is disproportionately large relative to that of its peers.

In general, the growth rate of these organizations is ten times faster than that of their competitors. All this is possible due to the fact that these business models use, in a strategic and efficient way, technological innovations based on market demand and needs.

### Why?

An ExO is one that is ten times better, faster, and cheaper than the others, because it has technology as its primary asset. It’s based on technology and as technology evolves and becomes cheaper, so does the organization leveraging it.
