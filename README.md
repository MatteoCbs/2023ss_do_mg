This is the repository of Matteo Gallinotto.

I am going to use Markdown in this class.

The class is at [cbs](https://cbs.de)

We are going to ~~ciao~~ learn:

- How digital organizations work.
- What modern types of organizations exist.
- Present in the browser

We are also pretending we are developers, because:

1. we use the CLI
1. we learn about the GitHub workflow
1. we will make a presentation in the browser.
1. We are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed ourselves.
